MEGAFLASHROM SCC+ SD 

USER'S MANUAL 

[DESCRIPTION] 

MegaFlashROM SCC+ SD is a combo cartridge with a SD card reader and an 
improved MegaFlashROM SCC+. 

Each device is located in a subslot, so the cartridge must be inserted 
in a primary slot. It will not work in a slot expander. 

OPFXSD is the software you must use to operate the cartridge. You can 
find it in the "FLASH" section of: 

www.msxcartridgeshop.com 

[MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS] 

*  MSX computer with at least one free Slot 

*  64K RAM (MSX-DOS) or 128K (MSX-DOS 2) 

[FEATURES] 

*  8192 KB (64 Mbits) flashROM memory 

*  Sound chips: SCC-I and PSG 

*  Mapper: ASC8, ASC16, Konami, Konami SCC, linear 48K/64K 

*  Compatible with MMC, SD and SDHC cards in FAT12 or FAT16 

*  Two micro SD slots 

*  High transfer speed. 

*  Recovery mode: Let's you configure the cartridge easily. 

[WORKING] 

Insert the MegaFlashROM SCC+ SD cart in one slot while the computer is 
turned off. 

Turn the computer on and Nextor (the disk operative system) will boot. 
If you need to reinstall the cartridge software check INSTALATION 
section. 

Execute OPFXSD by selecting the ROM and needed options. 

Once the ROM is stored the cartridge will behave as if it were the 
original one and won't be erased even if the computer is turned off. 

ESC key or the one configured through /T option must be pressed while 
computer is booting to avoid the execution of the cart. 

If it doesn't work, you can erase the cartridge using the recovery 
mode. Press CURSOR UP while booting. 

RESET key can be hold on pressed for 5 seconds to disable MegaFlashROM 
SCC+ temporarily if previous system would fail for any reason. 

[PSG] 

The PSG included in the cartridge is mapped to ports #10-#12.

[OPTIONS] 

/X 
Executes the game stored in the cartridge. 
OPFX KLORE2.ROM /X <- Stores the ROM and executes it 
OPFX /X <- Executes whatever is stored in the cartridge 

/E 
Patchs Konami ROMs to simulate that they are executed in an European 
computer 
OPFX USAS.ROM /E <- Shows the texts in English in a Japanese computer 

/J

computer 
OPFX NEMESIS3.ROM /J <- Shows the texts in Japanese in an European 
computer 

/8 
Enables the R800 CPU when executing the ROM or turbo mode of Panasonic 
WX/WSX/FX models. 

/Hxx 
Changes the Frequency when executing the ROM. It won't have any effect 
if the game change it again during its execution. 
/H50 <- 50 Hz 
/H60 <- 60 Hz 

/RCxx 
Simulates a Konami cart inserted in another slot. 
OPFX NEMESIS2.ROM /RC743<-Simulates Penguin Adventure 

/Kx 
Forces the execution of the ROM with a Konami mapper 
/K4 <- Konami 
/K5 <- Konami SCC 

/Ax 
Forces the execution of the ROM with a ASCII mapper 
/A8 <- ASC8 
/A16 <- ASC16 

/L 
Indicates that the ROM has no mapper and works in #0000-#FFFF area as 
48K or 64K roms. 

/M 
Manual mode. OPFXSD won't indentify the ROM mapper automatically. 

/C 
Erases the ROM stored in MegaFlashROM SCC+. 

/C1 Fully erases the cartridge (MegaFlashROM and SD kernel) 

/Sxx 
Forces the slot where the cartridge is placed: 
/S1 = Slot 1 
/S13 = Slot 1, subslot 3 

/T[rc] 
Fixes the key which will avoid the execution of the ROM stored in the 
cartridge. ESC acts in that way by default. To select the desired key it 
is necessary to select the file and column of the key matrix 
/T64 <- File 6, Column 4 = CODE 
/T82 <- File 8, Column 2 = INS 

[See keyboard matrices] 

/N 
Inverts the logic of the key that avoids the execution of the ROM 
(Pressed / Not pressed) 

/O 
Creates a MULTIROM with the games inside the MULTIROM.OPF file 
[See MULTIROM section] 

/F 
Executes the game by using a "soft reset”. 

/P 
Patchs a Konami ROM to use the PSG of the cartridge. So the sound 
balance of SCC and PSG is constant and perfect. 

/P1 Clone internal PSG using the external one. 

/Dx 
Loads a DSK (x=1 to 9) 
[See DSK] 

/I 
Installs cartridge’s software 

[See INSTALATION] 

/U 
Disables subslots and set MegaFlashROM SCC+ as unique device available. 

/1 
Write the ROM at x1 speed instead of x4. 


[INSTALATION] 

In case you need to reinstall the software, follow these steps. 

OPFXSD nextor.rom /I: 
Install SD kernel. Needed to use the SD interface. 

Note: this process must be done using another storage device different 
from the SD reader in the cartridge. You can also use RECOVERY mode to 
install the kernel. 

OPFXSD dskrom.rom /I1: 
Installs the diskROM used to load DSKs. Needed to run DSKs. 

OPFXSD romdisk.dsk /ID: 
Installs a ROM drive. The ROM drive enables you to put a diskimage into 
the flashrom. It will be mounted as an extra readonly drive. The ROM 
drive is always available (unless erased), even when not cards are 
inserted. It can be used to boot from or store files that you use 
regularly. 

OPFXSD recovery.rom /I34: 
Installs RECOVERY program. 

Note: Update only when the cartridge maker tells you to do it. 

[See RECOVERY] 

[RECOVERY] 

Recovery mode let’s you to configure the cartridge in a easy way, 
without using other disk interfaces. 

In order to enter the recovery menú, hold CURSOR UP while booting. The 
available options are: 

F1: Erase MegaFlashROM. 
This will erase the ROM stored in the MegaFlashROM SCC+. It is useful if 
the ROM is corrupted and can’t be disabled by pressing ESC. 

F2: Erase SD kernel 
Erasing the SD kernel the SD reader will be disabled and the MSX will 
not identify it as a disk interface. 

F3: Erase ROM disk 
Erase the disk image installed as ROM disk. 

F4: Install SD kernel 
Let's you reinstall the SD kernel, so the SD interface will work 
again. You must format a SD card a copy in it KERNEL.DAT file. 

F5: Show SD card information 
Shows information about the card and its partitions. 

Pressing LEFT and RIGHT you can change SD card slot. 

[DSK] 

A DSK file is a disk image that contains the information of the sectors 
of a real disk. 

It is possible to load and run up to 9 disk images of 720 KB. These 
files can be loaded and changed independently. It is not necessary to 
previously erase the former ones. Since the DSK are stored on flashROM 
memory, they will be read only. 

In order to load a DSK you must use /D option, followed by the number of 
disk you want to select (from 1 to 9) 

In example: 

OPFXSD undead.dsk /D1 

In games with several disks, you can change the disk by holding the 
desired number key when the disk is accessed (i.e.: after pressing space 
after a change disk dialog in a game) 

Pressing number 0 the disk access will be redirected to the next disk 
interface, probably the floppy disk. In this way you can save game data. 

Note: Remove any other external disk interfaces when loading DSKs. 

[MULTIROM] 

It is possible to put several games into the cartridge at the same time, 
as many as they fit in the cartridge's memory, up to 511. In order to 
create a multiROM, you need to make a MULTIROM.OPF file with the file 
names to load. Each file name must be in a text line and it is possible 
to set the mapper type after the name. Add at the end of the list the 
keyword [END]. In order to pause the loading process you can use 
[PAUSE]. Once this file is ready, you need to process the list using the 
option /O. The ROMs to load must be in the same path that OPFXSD and 
MUTIROM.OPF. 

Example of MULTIROM.OPF content: 

GALIOUS.ROM /K4 
HERO.ROM 
PENGUIN.ROM 
KLORE2.ROM 
[END] 

Command to make the multiROM: OPFXSD /O 

After booting the cartridge a menu will be show with the games in the 
cartridge. Before running the game it is possible to change the video 
and CPU modes. 

Controls: 

Cursor keys / Joystick 
Move 

Space / Fire 
Select 

TAB / Fire 2 
Enter / Exit configuration 

ESC 
Exit multiROM
